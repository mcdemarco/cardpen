hccdo
========

hccdo is a web-only version of [vaemendis](https://github.com/vaemendis)' hccd, an [HTML+CSS Card Designer](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd/) intended to generate printable HTML pages of playing cards from a spreadsheet of card descriptions and a simple Mustache template.  The original hccd is a java program, but the java bits weren't actually necessary to do what it does so I ([mcdemarco](https://github.com/mcdemarco)) removed them, and added some features:

* Support for Google or other web fonts.
* Flex layout to solve some table margin issues.
* Export cards as separate images at any dpi.

usage
--------

1. Open hccdo.  (Download this repository or use the online version.)
2. Edit the example or upload your own mustache template, csv file, and/or css file.  (You only need to upload once.  The css is optional.)
3. The csv file should have a header row plus a row for each card.  The header names for the columns are used in the template.  
3. Click the Generate HTML button for HTML.  Print the frame, being sure to turn off any scaling, headers, and footers.
4. Click the Generate Images button for images.  A Zip Images button appears above the images (which are above the original HTML in the frame); when all images have appeared, click it to download a zip file of the images.  You can also right-click and save the images individually from the frame if you prefer.

For more information, see [the documentation](doc/index.md).

running
----------

Although it is possible to open HCCDo in your browser as an html file (`index.html`), it really should be served by a webserver, due to various browser security issues.  There is a public server at [hccdo.mcdemarco.net](http://hccdo.mcdemarco.net)).

To make it easier to work with your own image files, you can run HCCDo on your own computer (instead of using the public install at  Check out hccdo locally, and, if you have your own webserver, just stick HCCDo under it somewhere; it doesn't need to be at the root.  If you don't already have a webserver, you can use a node webserver included with the package.  To set it up, [install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (the Node.js package manager), then, at the command line in the hccdo directory, run the following two commands:

> `npm install`
> `npm run server`

The second command will return the new URL for your local HCCDo (most likely [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

Place any images you need for your cards in the `images/` directory.

caveats
---------

Everything works in Chrome.  The image exporter doesn't work in Safari or iOS, but basic HTML generation should still work.  YMMV with other browsers.


building
-----------

HCCDo doesn't have much of a build process; it uses simple npm scripts instead of a build tool.
The build command, `npm run build`, just converts the docs from markdown to html.

HCCDo was inspired by [hccd](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd/).  HCCDo uses [mustache](https://mustache.github.io) for templating, [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com) for csv parsing, [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image/) (with [pr#103 for dpi settings](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image/pull/103)) for image generation, [FileSaver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) for saving, [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) for editing, and [bind](https://github.com/remy/bind.js) ([commit 0cdcdb36f3](https://github.com/remy/bind.js/tree/0cdcdb36f3207191527c6de5367a518334f08d48) with [pr#16](https://github.com/remy/bind.js/pull/16/files)) and [underscore](http://underscorejs.org) under the hood.

HCCDo uses the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) to fetch your game collection for generating IDKWDYWTP decks.  Due to an [issue with the API](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1304818/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors), HCCDo needs a proxy for CORS like [crossorigin.me](https://github.com/technoboy10/crossorigin.me) in order to fetch your collection.

The basic example makes very simple cards for the game [Pico](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2051/pico).  The examples directory contains a copy of the Pico example, an oval version of the Pico example, three more complicated examples for a retheme of the game [Sleuth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/594/sleuth), and copies of the [IDKWDYWTP](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28567/i-dont-know-what-do-you-want-play) examples. (There are also [a couple of examples](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd/tree/master/examples) included with the original [hccd](https://github.com/vaemendis/hccd/).)

The UI backgrounds are is Low Contrast Linen by Jordan Pittman and Fabric (Plaid) by James Basoo from [Subtle](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/low-contrast-linen/) [Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/fabric-plaid/).  The help page CSS was inspired by Firefox's Reader View and [Edward Morbius' website](http://codepen.io/dredmorbius/pen/KpMqqB).  Some images in the examples are from [Game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net).  The card icon is from the [EmojiOne Project](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/2.2.7/assets/svg/1f0cf.svg), version 2 (CC BY 4.0).
