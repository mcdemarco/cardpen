Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to replant the area with ten native tree, shrub, and vine species recommended by the Six Ponds Improvement Association.</p><div class='col-grid'><div class='col'><h2>Setup</h2><p>The seedling pots have been color-coded for your convenience:</p><ul><li><span class='brown'>brown:</span> White Pine tree <i>(Pinus strobus)</i></li><li><span class='green'>green:</span> Pitch Pine tree <i>(Pinus rigida)</i></li><li><span class='black'>black:</span> Black Gum tree a.k.a.

If fewer than four volunteers are available, you will not be assigned all ten species to plant.  For 3 volunteers, remove the cards for any 2 species (colors) from the deck; for 2 volunteers, remove 4 species.  Shuffle the remaining cards and deal 7 to each volunteer.  Place the rest of the deck in the center of the table.</p><h2>Objectives</h2><p>You will be assigned your own plot for planting.  To plan your plot, you will place cards representing your seedlings one at a time in a grid-like arrangement. You may leave holes in your plot, but each card should be adjacent to at least one other card.</p></div><div class='col'><p>In order to facilitate a random distribution of the new plants, each batch of seedlings has been numbered from 1 to 8.   You are encouraged to plant them by number in ascending order along a path within your plot.  In order to &ldquo;score&rdquo; a path, the plants at either end must be from the same species, while the intermediate ones can be of any species (but in ascending numerical order).  Seedlings may be shared between multiple paths.</p><div class='tableWrapper'><table style='table-layout:fixed;'><tr><td><div class='weecard gray'>6</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><div class='weecard orange'>2</div></td><td class='orange'>&rarr;</td><td> <div class='weecard yellow'>6</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td> <td class='orange'>&darr;</td>  <td></td> <td class='orange'>&darr;</td></tr><tr><td><div class='weecard purple'>1</div></td><td class='purple'>&rarr;</td><td><div class='weecard blue'>4</div></td><td class='purple'>&rarr;</td><td> <div class='weecard orange'>5</div></td><td><span class='purple'>&rarr;</span><br/><span class='orange'>&rarr;</span></td><td><div class='weecard purple'>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td> <td></td><td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td class='orange'>&darr;</td></tr><tr><td><div class='weecard gray'>5</div></td><td></td><td><div class='weecard yellow'>2</div></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td> <div class='weecard orange'>8</div></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></div><p>In the example above, the volunteer has planted a purple path and two orange paths (though only one path per species can score).</p><p>The second requirement for scoring a path is having the highest total value of cards of that species remaining <b><i>in your hand</i></b> at the end of the game.  If the above volunteer's hand was:</p><div class='tableWrapper'><table style='table-layout:fixed;'><tr><td><div class='weecard gray'>3</div></td><td><div class='weecard orange'>4</div></td><td> <div class='weecard yellow'>8</div></td><td><div class='weecard orange'>1</div></td><td><div class='weecard blue'>3</div></td><td> <div class='weecard pink'>5</div></td><td> <div class='weecard pink'>6</div></td></tr></table></div><p>then his total for orange would be 5; if that is the highest total for orange among the volunteers, he can score one orange path.  His total is 0 for purple, so he is unlikely to score his purple path.  The total of 11 in pink does not help him because his plot has no pink path.</p></div></div>\"\n\"<div class='col-grid'><div class='col'><h2>Order of Play</h2><p>Volunteers take turns planning their individual plots.  On your turn, you must:</p><ol><li>Draw a total of two cards from either the draw deck or off the top of any volunteer's discard pile, or both.</li><li>Plant one card in your plot (above, below or beside an already planted card).</li><li>Discard one card face up in your personal discard pile.</li></ol><p>At the end of your turn you should still have 7 cards in your hand.  When the draw pile runs out, the last volunteer to draw from it plants and discards as usual, and then you score.</p><h2>Scoring</h2><p>Recall that volunteers may only score a path for a species if they have the highest total value of seedlings of that species remaining in hand.  However, there is an exception to totalling up your species:  if one volunteer has an 8 in hand and another has a 1 in hand for the same species, the 8 is reduced to 0.  (The 1 still counts as a 1.)  In case of ties, each of the tied players may score one path for that species.  In particular, if no volunteers have a certain species remaining in hand, they may all score one path of that species.</p><p>It is possible for a volunteer&mdash;accidentally or intentionally&mdash;to win the right to score a path of a species, yet have no scoring path for that species.  (However vicious it may sound, the Six Ponds Improvement Association has determined that this process results in the most natural arrangement of native species.)</p><p>Once species scoring rights have been settled, volunteers then pick and score one path for each of their allowed species.</p></div><div class='col'><p>A path may contain from 2 to 8 cards.  Each qualifying path scores the following points:</p><ol><li>One point per card in the path.</li><li>If all cards in the path are the same color, one additional point per card.</li><li>One additional point for a 1.</li><li>Two additional points for an 8.</li></ol><p>For example, if the volunteer mentioned earlier won the right to score orange, his two orange paths score the same:  4 points for being four cards long, plus 2 points for containing an 8 for a total of 6 points (not 12).  If no one else had purple in hand either, he would score 5 points for purple.</p><p>Volunteers then total all their scoring paths and the highest total wins.  (In case of a tie, the tiebreakers are: the most species in one's plot, then having scored the most pine paths, and lastly, having the most pine species cards in one's plot.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Pinewoods Paths is a Pinewoods-themed version of the card game Arboretum by Dan Cassar.  Arboretum was first published by ZMan Games in 2014; a new version is expected from Renegade Game Studios in Fall 2018.
